000 The Library of Babel is infinite
015 Its hexagonal chambers \nstretch beyond sight
035 Its books contain every word \never written
054 and every word never meant to be
071 These letters can form anything \nand yet are meaningless
089 unless someone gathers them \nand forges true words from the chaos
117 By this, may you contemplate \nthe art of the 26 letters
